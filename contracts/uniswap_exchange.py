    1. Parameter definition: output_amount -> oa, input_reserve -> ir, output_reserve -> or, returned value -> ia
    2. The logic gives us the constrain:

            ia = ir * oa / [(or - oa) * (1 - fee)] + 1
    4. optimal conclusion:
            ia = [ir * oa + (or - oa) * (1 - fee) -1 ] / [(or - oa) * (1 - fee)]
